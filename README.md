# TokenExplorer: Exploring and Benchmarking Open Source Tokenizers

## 1. Project Overview
Tokenizers play a pivotal role in the preprocessing phase of text data, transforming raw text into a structured format that models can understand. The effectiveness of this step significantly impacts the overall performance of NLP models, making the choice of tokenizer a crucial decision in the development of language-based applications. However, with the plethora of tokenizers available, each with its unique approach and capabilities, selecting the most suitable one can be a daunting task. TokenExplorer aims to offer a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and comparing the performance and characteristics of open source tokenizers (currently based on English language), through a simple yet effective jupyter notebook. This facilitates the exploration of tokenizer characteristics such as tokenization speed, token granularity, handling of special characters, language support, and adaptability to domain-specific vocabularies. Users can perform detailed comparisons between tokenizers, assessing their suitability for specific applications, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, or semantic search.

Comparison of vocabulary size for different tokenizers. The number of tokens is calculated both form the exracted vocabulary and from the tokenizer decoder method.

## 2. Installation 
The installation process on Windows has been designed to be fully automated. To begin, simply run *start_on_windows.bat.* On its first execution, the installation procedure will execute with minimal user input required. The script will check if either Anaconda or Miniconda is installed and can be accessed from your system path. If neither is found, it will automatically download and install the latest Miniconda release from https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/. Following this step, the script will proceed with the installation of all necessary Python dependencies. Should you prefer to handle the installation process separately, you can run the standalone installer by running *setup/install_on_windows.bat*. 

**Important:** After installation, if the project folder is moved or its path is changed, the application will no longer function correctly. To fix this, you can either:

- Open the main menu, select *Setup and maintentance* and choose *Install project in editable mode*
- Manually run the following commands in the terminal, ensuring the project folder is set as the current working directory (CWD):

    `conda activate TOKEXP`

    `pip install -e . --use-pep517` 

## 3. How to use
On Windows, run *start_on_windows.bat* to launch the main navigation menu and browse through the various options. Please note that some antivirus software, such as Avast, may flag or quarantine python.exe when called by the .bat file. If you encounter unusual behavior, consider adding an exception for your Anaconda or Miniconda environments in your antivirus settings.

### 3.1 Navigation menu

**1) Run tokenizers benchmarks:** runs the benchmarks on all selected tokenizers and save the results in *resources/benchmarks*. For each tokenizer, the following benchmarking metrics are calculated, both using the extracted vocabulary and the decoder methods (from HF library), showing any possible discrepancy between the two approaches:

- **Text characters**: The number of characters in the original text.
- **Words count**: The number of words in the text.
- **AVG words length**: The average character length of words in the text.
- **Tokens count**: The total number of tokens generated by the tokenizer.
- **Tokens characters**: The total number of characters in the tokenized output.
- **AVG tokens length**: The average character length of tokens.
- **Tokens to words ratio**: The ratio of token count to word count.
- **Bytes per token**: The number of bytes per token, derived from the original text length.  

**1) Tokenizers analysis:** previosuly calculated benchmarks are visualized using different types of plots and visualization techniques (boxplots, histograms, bar plots). Requires generating the benchmarks results first!

**2) TokenExplorer setup:** allows running some options command such as *install project in editable mode* to reinstall the project within your environment, and *remove logs* to remove all logs saved in *resources/logs*.  

**3) Exit and close:** exit the program immediately

### 3.1 Resources
This folder is used to hold tokenizers and datasets, as well as to store the benchmark results. Here you can find the following folders:

**benchmarks:** contains the results of the tokenizers benchmarks that have been run. Generate plots are saved in *benchmarks/figures* while benchmark .csv files will be located in *benchmarks/results*.

**datasets:** contains the downloaded datasets that are used to test the tokenizers performance. While the datasets that are automatically downloaded are saved in *datasets*, the custom dataset are saved in *custom dataset*.

**tokenizers:** contains the downloaded tokenizers that are used to run the benchmarks on the target dataset. While the tokenizers from HuggingFace are automatically saved in *tokenizers*, the custom tokenizers must be located in *custom tokenizers*.

## 4. Configurations
For customization, you can modify the main configuration parameters using *settings/configurations.json* 

#### General configuration

| Parameter          | Description                                                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| TOKENIZERS         | List of tokenizers to download                                 |
| DATASET            | Target dataset to benchmark tokenizers                         |

Tokenizers should be specified using their reference string. Regarding the text dataset used for the benchmarks, it is necessary to provide both the configuration and corpus as per dataset specifics. 

#### Benchmark configuration

| Parameter                | Description                                              |

**Environmental variables** are stored in *setup/variables/.env*. For security reasons, this file is typically not uploaded to GitHub. Instead, you must create this file manually by copying the template from *resources/templates/.env* and placing it in the *setup/variables* directory.

| Variable              | Description                                              |
